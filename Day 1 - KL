#Day 1
In today’s course, I had a basic idea of how to collect data from various aspects. I learned a type of machine learning — supervised learning (knowing what the data 
is and what we are predicting). There are two types of data, the explanatory variable X and the response variable Y. And for Y, there are also two types: continuous
and discrete, which correspond to regression and classification problems respectively. I also learned two stages of the pipeline: stage I is mainly research which 
includes collecting data, processing, machine learning and back test, and stage II is packing things in stage I, so that when putting new data in the black box, it 
can give prediction as an output. I also learned some basic functions like data frame in R and some differences between R and Python. 

In the next three weeks, I would like to learn more about data and how to use R to do more complicated instructions as well its applications in real life.
