# Courses

## Pre Statistics

This course prepares high school students some basic and advanced understanding in probability and statistics. Moreover, it fast tracks your career and give you a high-level overview of the modern-day machine learning from statistical point of view. This course starts with basic concepts in the field of Probability Theory such as counting principles and move towards making inferences of random variables. With the foundation concepts in Probability Theory and Statistical Inference, this course lands on a capstone project in neural networks. The required textbooks are listed below. The first text, Probability and Statistics, is used commonly as first year undergraduate course for introduction of statistics and probability theory. The second text, The Elements of Statistical Learning, is widely used for advanced undergraduate courses and some of the master level courses. For the scope of this program, we will maintain difficulty level as the same of that of the first text. The course can be designed in two versions: regular session and honors session. The regular session assumes students with high school education. The honors session assumes students pass AP Statistics and AP Calculus. The course focuses on initiating some common concepts in probability and statistics in undergraduate level. The course also trains students to use software programs such as Python or R.

# Philosophy

There are the following philosophy I would like to address with my audience. 

## Teaching Philosophy: Trinity Set

Teaching philosophy can be explained with the following diagram. The first element is about Passion. Passion is what guides learning and if not the most essential element one can seek to learn something. The next element is Talent. Most students might gain unforunate prior experience of the idea that they do not have talent (perhaps from their parents, friends, or school environment). Do not let your prior fear dominate what you can become. Everyone has talent and it is okay we take our time to explore what they might be. But you need to keep exploring. We fail not because somebody else tells we are failure but when we stop exploring our talent. The last element is Wealth. A good explanation of Wealth is money, but it is only a vanilla or perhaps naive explanation. A better one is resources. Every market every sector has its unique hiearchy and it is up to us to explore what each level of the hiearchy has in terms resources. 

With the above definition given, the relationship of these three elements can be shown as the following diagram:

$$\text{Passion}$$
$$\nearrow\swarrow \text{   } \searrow\nwarrow$$
$$\text{Talent} \rightleftharpoons \text{Wealth}$$

- The left arrows connect Passion with Talent. If I am interested in a topic, it is more likely I spend more time on this topic. Then it makes sense I am getting better at it. The converse is also true. If I happen to stumble upon some skills that I am good at, it is veyr likely I want to keep doing things that way because I am good at it. It will make me fall in love of what I am doing. 

- The bottom arros connect Talent with Wealth. If I have a talent that is right on top of the competition pyramid that nobody else can get to, then I am in good shape and people want me to be there when they are in trouble which creates a market that generates wealth. The converse is true. When I have more money, I would very much like to strengthen the things that I used to generate that wealth so I can keep on making more money. 

- The right arrows connect Passion with Wealth. If I am passionate about a topic, then I love talking about it, reading news or stories about this topic, and spending more time with it. These series of actions will eventually broaden my pocket and resources about this topic which translate to wealth. The converse is also true. If I have wealth, resources I have on a topic can directly translates to passion if not reinforce it. 

Things to think about:
- What are some popular examples that holds all three elements of Trinity Set? LeBron James, Bill Gates, Elon Musk...
- Why is it called a Trinity Set? What happens when one side of arraws dissappear? 
- Why an ideal career path needs all three elements?

## Philosophy with Machine Learning / Data Science / Artificial Intelligence

There are three stages of learning curves down the road of pursuing Machine Learning / Data Science / Artificial Intelligence.

- Stage I: This stage is at the beginner level. There is a wide range of topics that I need to learn and I need to smash time to get through all of them as fast as I can. This means pick a common machine learning book and go through them word by word and topic by topic. Through this journey you also get a sense of what are the practices that other people do. More importantly, you need to explore what are the pros and cons of these practices. In brief, Stage I is about collecting tools.

- Stage II: This stage is at intermediate level. This is a level where you already known plenty of topics and you probably already seen some interesting projects. You need to test and examine if you can reproduce or carry out these projects yourself by looking at a brand new data set. It is time to explore as many data sets as possible and to go through as many projects as possible independently. In brief, Stage II is about broaden your horizon. 

- Stage III: This stage is at an advanced level. This level assumes you already went through Stage I and II. It means you know almost all of the tools and you have done plenty of projects independently and critically. However, through all these practices you have come across some issues that were never resolved by previous people (academically or industrial). You have gain some insights yourself about these issues and more importantly you have a solution that you found. It is time to come up with a software package to collect the tools you create and become the expert yourself. In brief, Stage II is about creation and your legacy. 

## What You Take Away From This Course

You only live once. Your life is your legacy! We all want to build a better world and a nice world. I am here to tell you: Ideals are peaceful. History is violent. 

You are here because you are entering college. This means you leave home for the first time in a very long time and you are about to write your own legacy. So you want to work hard and you want to deliver. Be the kind of person who thrives and shines. Be the kind of person who others look up to and who others can learn from. Show others what life can be. Show others what legacy is about. 

End of the day we are fighting off a common enemy: the extinction of mankind. Newton left us the laws in physics. Confucius left us laws in being the right person. Dr. MLK showed us what can be done as a regular citizen. Elon Musk sent a car to space. These are stories that will be told. These are the legacies we are left with. These are all noble work. What type of noble work will you choose do? What kind of tomorrow are you trying to build so you can start today?
