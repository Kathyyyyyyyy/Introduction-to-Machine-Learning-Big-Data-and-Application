# Courses

## Pre Statistics

This course prepares high school students some basic and advanced understanding in probability and statistics. Moreover, it fast tracks your career and give you a high-level overview of the modern-day machine learning from statistical point of view. This course starts with basic concepts in the field of Probability Theory such as counting principles and move towards making inferences of random variables. With the foundation concepts in Probability Theory and Statistical Inference, this course lands on a capstone project in neural networks. The required textbooks are listed below. The first text, Probability and Statistics, is used commonly as first year undergraduate course for introduction of statistics and probability theory. The second text, The Elements of Statistical Learning, is widely used for advanced undergraduate courses and some of the master level courses. For the scope of this program, we will maintain difficulty level as the same of that of the first text. The course can be designed in two versions: regular session and honors session. The regular session assumes students with high school education. The honors session assumes students pass AP Statistics and AP Calculus. The course focuses on initiating some common concepts in probability and statistics in undergraduate level. The course also trains students to use software programs such as Python or R.

### Materials

We focus on selected topics in the required textbooks above. Topics are described under Course Schedule below. For additional textbooks, please reach out to Yiqiao Yin for more resources. It is also recommended for students to have a working laptop or desktop. Please install R / RStudio for homework as well as capstone project.
- R/RStudio (required): please refer to [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/), we will be using this IDE as main development environment
- Python/Jupyter Lab (optional)
- Github (a website repo where students show case their projects)

# Philosophy

There are the following philosophy I would like to address with my audience. 

## Teaching Philosophy

$$\text{Passion}$$
$$\nearrow\swarrow \text{   } \searrow\nwarrow$$
$$\text{Talent} \longleftrightarrow \text{Wealth}$$
