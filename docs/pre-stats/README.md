# README

This folder contains lecture notes of Pre-Statistics. There are in total of 5 lecture notes. Each is approximately 1-hour in length. The lectures start with introduction in probability theory and statistical inference. Next, the lectures move towards application in machine learning. There is a capstone project for students to show case their independent project. 

## Content

- [Topic1](https://github.com/yiqiao-yin/SML/blob/main/docs/pre-stats/Topic1.md) starts with the introduction of basic probability and counting principle. The goal is to take what students have touched upon in AP Statistics and move away towards undergraduate level of some of the basic understanding and terminologies that are used in a scholarly environment.

- [Topic2](https://github.com/yiqiao-yin/SML/blob/main/docs/pre-stats/Topic2.md) continues the course to random variables. The goal is to set up some basic rules of how things can change under certain known situation. 

- [Topic3](https://github.com/yiqiao-yin/SML/blob/main/docs/pre-stats/Topic3.md) picks up from where we left off with random variables and immediately jumps right in expectation, variance and moments of a random variable. With these ideas explained, we can start to discuss asymptotic distributions. This is the area where we look at data of a sample of population and we can try to generalize by making inferences of what the actual population is like. 

- [Topic4](https://github.com/yiqiao-yin/SML/blob/main/docs/pre-stats/Topic4.md) starts with point estimator with the famous topic Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE). We will introduce how to approximate a statistic that we are interested in and what we can do to test a hypothesis. 

- [Topic5](https://github.com/yiqiao-yin/SML/blob/main/docs/pre-stats/Topic5.md) starts with application in machine learning. We jump right in linear regression and logistic regression. We will land on deep learning families and cover three most widely used methods (Artificial Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, and Recurrent Neural Network).
