# Random Variables

Random Variables: 

What is a random variable? 
How to measure a random variable? 
What is the distribution of a random variable? 
What is the difference between discretized random variable and continuous random variable? What are some common random variables (uniform, Bernoulli)? 
What is joint distribution?

Marginal Distribution: 

What is the marginal distribution of a joint distribution?

Functions of Random Variables: 

Given information of a random variable, what can we say about a transformation of this random variable? 
How about transformation for joint random variables?
What is a convolution?
What is a linear transformation?

R Programming: 

We can use R to introduce different random variables and we can observe what these random variables look like.
