# Random Variables

Random Variables: 
- What is a random variable? 
- How to measure a random variable? 
- What is the distribution of a random variable? 
- What is the difference between discretized random variable and continuous random variable? What are some common random variables (uniform, Bernoulli)? 
- What is joint distribution?

Marginal Density / Distribution: 
- What is the marginal distribution of a joint distribution?

Functions of Random Variables: 
- Given information of a random variable, what can we say about a transformation of this random variable? 
- How about transformation for joint random variables?
- What is a convolution?
- What is a linear transformation?

Remark:
- A discrete random variable has probability mass function (PMF).
- A continuous random variable has probability density function (PDF).
- A PMF/PDF has cumulative distribution function (CDF). 
- A joint density function or a joint mass function of $X$ and $Y$ refers to the PMF/PDF of random variables $X$ and $Y$. In higher dimension, there can be more than two random variables.
- A joint distribution function is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a joint PMF/PDF. 
- A marginal distribution / density function is referring to what happens to the joint function if I am only considering $X$.

R Programming: 
We can use R to introduce different random variables and we can observe what these random variables look like.
