Expectation: 
- What is the expectation of a random variable? 
- What is the variance of a random variable? 
- What is the covariance of two random variables? 
- What is the correlation coefficient of two random variables? What is the property of a correlation coefficient?

Moment: 
- What is a moment generating function? 
- Why is it helpful?

Large Random Samples: 
- What are some basic inequalities in probability theory? 
- What is Law of Large Numbers? 
- What is Central Limit Theorem?

R Programming: 
- What does Pi look like?
- This programming project we can simulate what does Pi look like?
