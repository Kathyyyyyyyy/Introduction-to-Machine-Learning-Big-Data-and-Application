# Linear Regression and Logistic Regression

Linear Regression:
- What is a linear-model line? 
- What is a linear regression model? 
- What is a multivariate linear regression model? 
- What is polynomial regression?

Feature Selection: 
- What is a common way of selecting features of a data / partitioning data?

Classification: 
- What is an odds ratio?
- What is a logistic regression?
- What is gradient descent?
- What is a single-layer neural network?

Deep Learning: 
- How does neural network learn? 
- What is a loss function? 
- What is Convolutional Neural Network? 
- What is Recurrent Neural Network?

R Programming: 
- We use R to illustrate how linear regression can be applied on real data. 
- Instead of regression, we can also apply logistic function so that we can model odds ratio. 
- We can use linear regression to model housing sales. We can use logistic regression to model which type of flower can we claim from looking at the shape of the flower.
