# Capstone Project

## Brief

Capstone Project completes the materials of the entire Advanced Statistics Program and provides students the tools to diagnose some of the most complicated problems in the modern-day Artificial Intelligence.

## Installation

Please refer [here](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/installation/) for installation of Tensorflow RStudio interface. It is strongly recommended to use RStudio Cloud because we have a unified system and backend environment. However, it is also optional if students want to install this in personal RStudio environment. It is mandated to use R because the backend of the environment calls for Python. This way students gain experiences of both languages.

## Detail

The final project focuses on the field of deep learning. It is strongly recommended for students to select one of the following options. These options are Artificial Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, and Recurrent Neural Network. Each of the options focus on a different perspective of deep learning and the project may or may not use the same data sets from each other. The project teaches students to identify a key program of a data set and provide a known technique to solve this problem with robust performance.

### Requirements

- All students must have an independent Github Repo for Capstone Project. You are welcomed to copy/fork mine and develop from there. You do not have to start fresh. However, you must have README file in each folder. For software package, you can copy my sample package repo [here](https://github.com/yiqiao-yin/YinsKerasNN).
- All students should have Github Repo set up following the structure of this course repo. This means everyone should have folders specifically dedicated to *docs*, *pics*, *scripts*, and so on. Each folder must have a *README* file explaining in a few sentences what the folder is about. The capstone project must have one of the following output: (i) a notebook, (ii) a PDF, (iii) a graph, (iv) a table for presentation purpose. For example, in stock data, I have shown you a plot (the bullet curve). In visualization of *Pi*, I have shown you an animation. In deep learning script (we haven't discussed in depth yet), I have shown you a confusion table. 
- All students must present using one or a combination of the following materials: Github repo, slides, or papers.

Please read the following *Grading Scheme*:
- Structure: You must have a Github repo as a final submission. This repo should have 
    * README.md
    * "scripts" folder (must)
    * "docs" folder (must)
    * "data" folder (if any)
- Each folder must have its own README file (even if it's just one sentence). 
- The "scripts" folder must have all your code saved in names you can recognize. 
- The "docs" folder must have all your document (slides or PDF) for you to make presentation.
- You must have an installable software package named after yourself. You can directly copy my sample package repo [here](https://github.com/yiqiao-yin/YinsKerasNN) and change everywhere with "Yins" to "YOUR_LASTNAME".

The final output of your capstone project is the following:
- You are a fundamental AI researcher and you can provide a pipeline to solve ONE type of AI problem. <= This can be elaborated to help you apply for any Quantitative Researcher or Data Scientist jobs.
- You are a software programmer and you deliver code! You publish a deep learning software package and this open-source software speaks for your programming ability. <= This can help you to apply for Software Engineer jobs.

### Bonus

For students who want to challenge themselves, students can seek out answers to the following questions:
- What is the market for this software package?
- What problem does this package solve?
- What is the potential audience for this package?
- What needs to be further developed?

## Option

Please select the following: (i) Neural Network, (ii) Convolutional Neural Network, (iii) Recurrent Neural Network

Sample Project:
- Keras RStudio Examples: [here](https://keras.rstudio.com/articles/examples/index.html).
- Here is a basic example: [here](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tutorials/beginners/).
- Basic Classification: [here](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tutorials/beginners/).
- Basic Image Classification: [here](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tutorials/beginners/basic-ml/tutorial_basic_classification/).

If you do not have any clue what project you should do, please feel free to directly work with one of the sample pages in the above links as your project. You can make small changes or baby steps of the script to twist the model to see if you can come up with something different.
