# Capstone Project

## Brief

Capstone Project completes the materials of the entire Advanced Statistics Program and provides students the tools to diagnose some of the most complicated problems in the modern-day Artificial Intelligence.

## Detail

The final project focuses on the field of deep learning. It is strongly recommended for students to select one of the following options. These options are Artificial Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network, and Recurrent Neural Network. Each of the options focus on a different perspective of deep learning and the project may or may not use the same data sets from each other. The project teaches students to identify a key program of a data set and provide a known technique to solve this problem with robust performance.

## Option

Please select the following: (i) Neural Network, (ii) Convolutional Neural Network, (iii) Recurrent Neural Network
