# HOMEWORK

# HW 1

- please refer to this page: https://github.com/yiqiao-yin/SML/blob/main/docs/pre-stats/Topic1.md
- please simply "google" all the key words and see what you come what with, make a list of internet websites and hyperlinks of whatever you think it's important and related to these key words
- ask yourself this question: why are these concepts helpful?

# HW 2

What is the mean and standard deviation of a uniform random variable?
What is the marginal distribution of a joint distribution?
What is a moment generating function? Why is it helpful?

Coding exercise:
Simulate an experiment (the exact framework as what we did in class): what does Pi look like? (Pi is 3.141592653 ....) Please refer to https://github.com/yiqiao-yin/SML/blob/main/scripts/R/topic2_LLN.R#L29-L42 if you are confused how to start.

# HW 3

Part I: 
1. Given a sequence of data, what is the likelihood function?
2. What is MLE?
3. What is the asymptotic distribution for this MLE?
4. What is hypothesis testing?
Bonus: if you can write in mathematical form, that's even better. But it's not required.

Part II:
1. Go through this link: https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tutorials/beginners/; and run line by line in RStudio and see if you can get them running. I would advise you to copy the code directly from website. But you should type the comment and try to understand what the comment is saying.
2. Answer the following question about what do you want to do with your Capstone Project:
(i) What is the topic of your capstone project? (It's strongly recommended to pick between FinTech, Machine Learning, or Deep Learning)
(ii) What is an interesting you are trying to answer? (For example, how to visulize Pi is a question. As another example, how to allocate weights amongst different stocks?)
(iii) What is your proposed solution? (It could be a direct application of a mathematical model, ex. we tried to apply Bernoulli idea in stocks data example, another example is we try to come up with a simulation to visualize pi)

# HW4

Please derive the following:

I. MLE
Given X1, X2, ... drawn from Normal(mu, sigma), assume mu is known. What is the MLE of sample mean (this is defined as the summation term we discussed in class).

II. Asymptotic Distribution of MLE
We discussed the final conclusion of asymptotic distribution. In doing so, we need expectationo of X-bar and variance of X-bar. I gave you the results. Derive them.

III. Loss function and Gradient Descent
We discussed in class what is loss function of MSE. In the procedure, we assume linear model y ~ bX. What do we do when the model is logistic? Derive this. (You simply take partial derivative of a logistic model). 

IV. Capstone Project
Please submit the following before the next class:
- submit a github link (make sure you have a "script" folder and you have a sample script that is the neural network tutorial in it)
- submit the answer to the following questions:
What is the title of your project?
What is the data of your project?
What do you intend to do? 
Are you able to create a final production?
Comment: Whatever you do, you need to land on a final production that is either a table, chart, or animation.
